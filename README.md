  Welcome to Messaging Customised. This is a school simple project in order to
  learn how to make APIs and using websockets.
---

# Welcome!

### How does it work?

The website and API utilises the [Express framework](https://expressjs.com/) and we use [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) in order to provide real time events and updates to the user's client. To store messages, channels, users and other data structures, we use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and the [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) driver.

### What is the point of it?

We want to allow people to make their own clients to interact with the API, including but not limited to bots! There will likely be more to come in the future, as well as a public server for people to connect to.
