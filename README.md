# Messaging-Customised

## A Chatting Platform Using Express and Socket.IO

### How does it work?

The website and our API runs on an Express webserver, and in order for everything to work in realtime we use Socket.IO. We use MongoDB to store messages and user profiles using the mongoose driver, and dotenv for storing enviroment varibles.
